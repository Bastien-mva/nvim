# nvimConfig
My configuration for neovim 


should add the following line of code before configuring otherwise it won't get the packer plugin. 

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```


you should put the file in your ```~/.config``` directory
